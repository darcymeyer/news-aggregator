FOR NOW: we're using a pre-written fast&cheap text summarizer
LATER: we may write our own summarizer (or learn how to use IBM Watson)

Just download a github thing for summarization

Start the django !

OK now even though it's a really rough version, make the Cordova app as proof of concept, and it will be easier to adapt after a basic thing is written
