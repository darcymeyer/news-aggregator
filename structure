Two parts: Django on a server and Cordova on a phone

Django
Actually does the aggregating and processing
Always running
Has an API that the Cordova queries
Periodically checks RSS feeds and puts it into a template that it serves up on the API

Cordova
Simple front-facing thing on the phone
Just queries the Django API for the latest update
  This should be fast since it should already have been aggregated, and it just has to be served
Has a summary on the app ()
