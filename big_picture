So we're going to need to organize everything for it to be useful

WHen a big event happens, lots of different sources report on it

So, we need to aggregate articles about the same story into the same place

So we need IBM Watson to determine what keywords a story is about

Our scripts will look at all the topics the results are about, and if there are a lot on the same thing, and published around the same date, it will group them together
(YES!)

When some story topic reaches a critical mass of popularity (maybe also scrape Twitter?) it sends a notification


Now, how to group this in the JSON response?


Hmm...


So we'll have a key "Breaking" and under that will be story topics
  and under each story topic will be a processed and coagulated summary (that is text) of what's going on, taken from the sources
  and alongside that will be all the story objects
